**Description:** 
This project aims to explore how customer characteristics and card features influence spending patterns across credit card families. Three essential datasets were used:

- **Card Base**: Contains general information about all credit cards issued by the bank.
- **Customer Base**: Includes key demographic and status information for each customer.
- **Transactions Base**: Records all credit card transactions, including customer ID, transaction date, and amount.

By merging these datasets, I analyzed purchasing behavior by card family and identified the main factors affecting spending. The analysis focused on demographic characteristics (such as age and customer status) and their relationship with total spending, as well as how credit card benefits relate to purchasing power.

**Key Business Questions:**   

- Which credit card family has the highest total transaction value?
- Does credit limit affect total spending?
- Which age group contributes the most to overall spending, and is there a link between age, card family, and credit limit?
- Which months show the highest purchasing activity?
- What strategies could increase spending for card families with lower performance?

**My Hypothesis:**

- The higher the credit limit, the greater the spending.
- Customers classified as **Diamond** contribute most to total spending due to stronger financial conditions and card benefits.
- Younger customers spend more overall.
- **December** is expected to be the peak month for purchases.

**My insights and recommendations:** 

**Card targeting by age and credit limit:**

Customers aged **41–50** show the highest total spending and primarily use Gold cards. According to the analysis, this group accounts for **36,138,092** in purchases — approximately **41% of the total transaction value.** This segment appears to respond well to moderate credit limits. Expanding Gold card issuance within this age group may represent a low-risk, high-impact opportunity for the bank.

**Maximize Diamond customer value:**

Diamond-tier customers, particularly in the **20–30 and 41–50 age groups**, demonstrate high purchase activity, with **3,373 and 3,556 transactions**, respectively, during the year. Offering them targeted promotions in **January and February** — typically lower-spending months — could boost early-year revenue and strengthen customer engagement.

**Strategic balance of affordability and potential:**

These strategies align card offerings with customers' financial behavior, optimizing for both spending potential and risk management.
